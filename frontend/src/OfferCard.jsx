              The polar aurora is a phenomenon characterized visually by light bands which take on a wide range of shapes and colours, rapidly changing in time
              and space, usually of red-green-blue colour, called auroral arcs, caused by the interaction of charged particles (protons and electrons) of solar
              origin (solar wind) with the Earthâ€™s ionosphere (atmosphere between 100-500 km): these particles excite atoms of the atmosphere which, when
              deactivated, emit light of various wavelengths. It is called aurora borealis if in the northern (boreal) hemisphere, while the name southern
              aurora refers to the analogue of the southern (southern) hemisphere.
